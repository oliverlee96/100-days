// Window is a built in global object with many functions - you don't need to access them by window.[function] but you can if you like

//"Document" object, window.document
// Has functions inside to access HTML

//DOM = Document Object Model
//Browser translates the HTML code into a bunch of nested objects effectively, to show the structure
//These are stored as JavaScript objects so that we can use JS to extract data and interact with/manipulate it
